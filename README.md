Sushi-Go-Round-Bot
==================

Bot to automatically play Sushi Go Round.

The detection method is some basic computer vision concepts. If you are not running at 1920x1080 you will need
to change some of the settings (lines 7-8, 26-58). If you are running at this resolution, dock your text editor / ide on the left
and Sushi Go Round on the right.
